This application is a real-life inspired dispatch system for emergency management in Bucharest. It models a map of the city with important locations such as the Parliament Palace, National Arena, crowded zones, and key police stations. The app allows a "112 dispatcher" to select police stations and set the number of available units at each. In the event of a major emergency, the dispatcher inputs the number of units needed at each point of interest and triggers an alert.

Behind the scenes, the application implements an algorithm based on the mathematical Transport Theory theorem, which optimally distributes police resources (units) to meet the demand at critical locations. Knowing the distances between police stations and points of interest, the system calculates the most efficient allocation to minimize response times. The app automatically dispatches units by calling the stations and animates police cars traveling to their assigned locations, showing estimated arrival times.
